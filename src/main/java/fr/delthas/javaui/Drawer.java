/**
 * Drawer is an interface on which to draw a component, to be called from a component {@link Component#render(InputState, Drawer)} method.
 * <p>
 * There are several methods to draw simple geometric shapes, images (actually {@link Texture}) objects, and text. Apart from drawing methods, there is a translation stack, that lets push a x and y amount to be added on all passed coordinates (to be popped before returning). The drawer also stores a default color in its internal state, that can be set with {@link #setColor(Color)}, that it uses to draw geometric shapes and text. There are also utilities method related to text drawing, such as {@link #getLineHeight(Font, float)}.
 * <p>
 * All passed coordinates are <b>RELATIVE to the component rectangle</b> lower-left corner.
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * // draw an image at the lower-left corner of the component
 * drawer.image(0, 0, texture).draw();
 * // draw an image by stretching it on the whole component
 * drawer.image(0, 0, texture).size(getWidth(), getHeight()).draw();
 *
 * // draw an image by fitting it on the component, centering it
 * drawer.imageIn(0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight(), texture).centered(true);
 *
 * // draw/fill a rectangle using the default color
 * drawer.rectangle(50, 50, 200, 200).draw();
 * // draw/fill a white rectangle, with a 45Â° angle
 * drawer.rectangle(50, 50, 200, 200).angle(Math.PI / 4).color(Color.WHITE).draw();
 *
 * // draw/fill a white circle
 * drawer.circle(20, 50, 40).color(Color.WHITE).draw();
 *
 * // draw/fill a ring using the default color, centered on the component
 * drawer.ring(getWidth() / 2, getHeight() / 2, 100, 10).centered(true).draw();
 *
 * // draw text using the default color, centered vertically on the component
 * drawer.text(100, getHeight() / 2, ">hello!!<", Font.COMIC, 16).centered(false, true).draw();
 * }
 * </pre>
